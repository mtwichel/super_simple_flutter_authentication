# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will convert the existing verifyJwt function and OAuth integrations to support generic OAuth providers beyond just Google and Apple. Currently, the system has provider-specific implementations for Google and Apple sign-in that each handle JWT verification with their own public keys and validation rules. The goal is to create a unified, configurable system that can work with any OAuth provider that follows standard OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the authentication server, I want to configure any OAuth provider that follows standard OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect specifications, so that I can support authentication from multiple providers without writing provider-specific code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides OAuth provider configuration THEN the system SHALL accept standard OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect parameters including issuer URL, client ID, and JWKS endpoint
2. WHEN the system receives a JWT token from any configured OAuth provider THEN it SHALL verify the token using the provider's public keys from their JWKS endpoint
3. IF an OAuth provider follows OpenID Connect discovery THEN the system SHALL automatically discover the JWKS endpoint from the provider's well-known configuration
4. WHEN configuring a new OAuth provider THEN the system SHALL require only the issuer URL and client ID as minimum configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with existing Google and Apple integrations, so that current implementations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing Google sign-in code calls the current SignInWithGoogle class THEN it SHALL continue to work exactly as before
2. WHEN existing Apple sign-in code calls the current SignInWithApple class THEN it SHALL continue to work exactly as before
3. WHEN the generic OAuth verification is used THEN it SHALL support Google and Apple as standard OAuth providers
4. IF a developer chooses to migrate from provider-specific classes to generic OAuth THEN the functionality SHALL remain identical

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want OAuth provider configurations to be environment-based, so that I can use different providers or settings across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support configuration via environment variables
2. WHEN multiple OAuth providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support JSON-based configuration for complex setups
3. IF no provider-specific configuration is found THEN the system SHALL fall back to auto-discovery using standard OpenID Connect endpoints
4. WHEN provider configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload the configuration without requiring application restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation for OAuth tokens, so that I can provide meaningful feedback when authentication fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JWT token has an invalid signature THEN the system SHALL return a specific error indicating signature verification failure
2. WHEN a JWT token is expired THEN the system SHALL return a specific error with expiration details
3. WHEN a JWT token has an invalid audience claim THEN the system SHALL return a specific error indicating audience mismatch
4. WHEN a JWT token has an invalid issuer claim THEN the system SHALL return a specific error indicating issuer mismatch
5. WHEN the JWKS endpoint is unreachable THEN the system SHALL return a specific error and optionally use cached keys if available
6. WHEN a JWT token is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a specific error indicating the parsing failure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generic OAuth verification to extract standard user information from tokens, so that I can access user data consistently across different providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid JWT token is verified THEN the system SHALL extract the user's email address if present
2. WHEN a valid JWT token is verified THEN the system SHALL extract the user's unique identifier (sub claim)
3. WHEN a valid JWT token is verified THEN the system SHALL extract additional standard claims like name, picture, and email_verified if present
4. WHEN user information is extracted THEN the system SHALL return it in a standardized format regardless of the OAuth provider
5. IF required user information is missing from the token THEN the system SHALL return a specific error indicating which claims are missing
